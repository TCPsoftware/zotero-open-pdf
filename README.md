# Warning

Modifying PDFs outside of Zotero (e.g., deleting, moving, or rotating pages) may result in inconsistencies with Zotero-created annotations!

Rotating and deleting individual pages can be done safely from the thumbnails tab of the Zotero PDF reader sidebar. Please consult Zotero's support pages about [using an external PDF reader](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/annotations_in_database).

# Support - read carefully

My time is extremely limited for a number of very great reasons (you shall have to trust me on this). Because of this, I
cannot accept bug reports
or support requests on anything but the latest version. If you submit an issue report,
please include the version that you are on. By the time I get to your issue, the latest version might have bumped up
already, and you
will have to upgrade (you might have auto-upgraded already however) and re-verify that your issue still exists.
Apologies for the inconvenience, but such
are the breaks.
